# jekyll-raw
Attempt to set up a Jekyll site straight from GitHub

This uses the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
It's the only [supported theme](https://pages.github.com/themes/) with layouts for posts, pages, _and_ home.
([hacker](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker) and [minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) have posts; everything else only has a default layout.)
See its README for information about how to customize it.
