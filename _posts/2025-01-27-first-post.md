Hello and welcome!

I created this site from scratch on the GitHub web site.
No command line or IDE required!
It uses Jekyll to render the pages, and publishes them via GitHub Pages.

The filenames for posts have to include the date and title in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-my-post-title.md`.
The title can be overriden with the `title:` front matter, like in [this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluegraybox/jekyll-raw/refs/heads/main/_posts/2025-01-27-first-post.md).

`layout: post` only works with themes that support it --- they have a `post.html` file in their `_layouts` directory, [like minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_layouts).
