# Media Files
Put images etc. here.

Link to them like so:
```
![alt text](./media/file.ext)
```
in the top-level pages.
For posts, the path would begin with `../../../media/` because posts are rendered into a `YYYY/MM/DD/` subdirectory, so you have to go up three levels.
(No, an absolute `/media/` path doesnâ€™t work, sadly.)
